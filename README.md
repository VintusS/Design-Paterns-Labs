# Design Patterns Labs
This is a repository for the laboratory works assigned for the Design Patterns course. 
## [Lab 0 - SOLID](https://github.com/VintusS/Design-Patterns-Labs/tree/main/SOLID)
In this lab work, I implemented the SOLID principles in a Java-based restaurant simulation. 
The project showcased how these principles lead to cleaner, maintainable, and flexible code, demonstrating concepts like single responsibility, open-closed design, and dependency inversion through the roles of various restaurant employees.
