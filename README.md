# Design Patterns Labs
This is a repository for the laboratory works assigned for the Design Patterns course. 
## [Lab 0 - SOLID](https://github.com/VintusS/Design-Paterns-Labs/tree/main/SOLID)
In this lab work, I implemented the SOLID principles in a Java-based restaurant simulation. 
The project showcased how these principles lead to cleaner, maintainable, and flexible code, demonstrating concepts like single responsibility, open-closed design, and dependency inversion through the roles of various restaurant employees.

## [Lab 1 - Creational Patterns](https://github.com/VintusS/Design-Paterns-Labs/tree/main/CreationalPatterns)
Made a simple coffee shop simulation that used the `Builder`, `Factory`, `Singleton` and `Prototype` patterns to ease the brewing of different coffee drinks based on customer preferences and requests.
